\begin{abstract}
This project enhances the KetoPilot mobile platform by implementing a graduate-level \emph{Sharing + Privacy module} that empowers users to decide what to share, with whom, and for how long. Our system, \textbf{KetoLink}, focuses on four integrated features—custom sharing profiles, an anonymous peer support community, time-limited sharing links, and a transparent privacy audit dashboard. 

The implementation leverages a robust Flutter architecture featuring Riverpod for state management and an offline-first design using SQLite and Mock Firebase services. This paper details the full implementation, including the database schema, security mechanisms, and the "Local Testing Mode" that allows development without backend dependencies. Through these features, KetoLink demonstrates that human-centered privacy design and technical feasibility can coexist in a deployable mHealth system.

\section{Introduction}

As wearable and health-tracking technologies evolve, users generate large volumes of metabolic and behavioral data every day. Such data hold immense potential for medical research, preventive healthcare, and personal wellness, yet they also expose individuals to new privacy and ethical challenges. Most health-tracking systems today treat privacy as an afterthought, forcing users into a binary choice: either share everything or remain isolated.

The goal of this project is to bridge that gap. \textbf{KetoLink} extends the existing KetoPilot mobile platform with a modular \emph{Sharing + Privacy layer}. Rather than treating privacy as a restriction, KetoLink reframes it as a meaningful design element. This paper documents the complete implementation of KetoLink, highlighting its technical architecture, local database integration, and the successful deployment of four core privacy features.

\subsection{Related Work}

Existing health data sharing platforms such as Apple HealthKit and Google Fit provide basic data aggregation but lack granular sharing controls. Research platforms like Open Humans \cite{macrofactor} enable data donation but require users to trust centralized repositories. KetoLink differentiates itself by providing \emph{user-controlled, time-limited, and auditable} data sharing directly within the health tracking workflow.

\section{Project Motivation}

KetoPilot, the base platform, enables tracking of glucose, ketone, and GKI levels. However, it lacked granular control over data dissemination. Interviews with pilot users revealed three key needs:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Selective sharing with professionals (e.g., sharing only weekly averages, not raw data).
    \item Motivation from peers without exposing real-world identity.
    \item Verification of data access history (Audit capability).
\end{enumerate}

KetoLink addresses these challenges through an ethical, transparent, and human-centered data-sharing ecosystem. The system implements the principle of "Privacy by Design" \cite{privdesign}, ensuring that privacy controls are not retrofitted but built into the core architecture.

\section{Technical Architecture}

To ensure scalability, maintainability, and testability, KetoLink adopts a modern layered architecture with clear separation of concerns.

\subsection{State Management and Dependency Injection}

We utilize \textbf{Riverpod} for robust state management. This allows us to separate business logic from the UI layer. `StreamProvider` is extensively used to implement real-time data updates, ensuring that any change in the sharing profiles or community posts is instantly reflected in the UI without manual refreshing.

The dependency injection pattern is implemented through Riverpod's `Provider` system. For example, the `SharingProfileRepository` is provided as a singleton, ensuring consistent data access patterns across the application:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Dart, caption=Riverpod Provider Configuration]
final sharingProfileRepositoryProvider = 
    Provider<SharingProfileRepository>((ref) {
  final service = ref.watch(firebaseServiceProvider);
  return SharingProfileRepository(service);
});
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Repository Pattern}

The application implements the Repository Pattern to abstract the data layer. Interfaces such as `SharingProfileRepository` and `PrivacyAuditRepository` define the contract. This design is crucial for our "Dual Mode" capability (discussed in Section V), allowing the app to switch seamlessly between a live Firebase backend and a local SQLite database.

Each repository implements methods for CRUD operations while maintaining a consistent API. For instance, the `SharingProfileRepository` provides:
\begin{itemize}
    \item `createProfile(SharingProfile profile)`: Creates a new sharing profile
    \item `getProfiles(String userId)`: Retrieves all profiles for a user
    \item `updateProfile(String id, SharingProfile profile)`: Updates an existing profile
    \item `deleteProfile(String id)`: Removes a profile and logs the deletion
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Data Modeling}

We use the \textbf{Freezed} package to create immutable data models. This ensures type safety and automatically generates `toJson`/`fromJson` serialization code, reducing boilerplate and preventing runtime errors during API communication.

\section{Implementation of Core Features}

The KetoLink module consists of four fully implemented features, each addressing a specific privacy and sharing need.

\subsection{Sharing Profiles}

Users can create multiple profiles (e.g., "Doctor", "Coach") with fine-grained control over what data is shared and at what granularity.

\textbf{Implementation Details:}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Granularity Control:} Users select data granularity from five options: Raw, Hourly Average, Daily Average, Weekly Average, and Monthly Average. This allows professionals to receive aggregated insights without accessing sensitive minute-by-minute data.
    \item \textbf{Expiration:} Profiles have a strict `expiresAt` timestamp. Once expired, the profile automatically becomes inactive, preventing indefinite data access.
    \item \textbf{Status Management:} Active/Inactive toggles update instantly via Riverpod providers, ensuring real-time synchronization across all UI components.
    \item \textbf{Metric Selection:} Users can selectively share specific metrics (glucose, ketone, GKI, weight, heart rate) while keeping others private.
\end{itemize}

The data model ensures strict typing for metrics:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Dart, caption=Sharing Profile Data Structure]
@freezed
class SharingProfile with _$SharingProfile {
  const factory SharingProfile({
    required String id,
    required String userId,
    required String profileName,
    required List<String> metrics,
    required String granularity,
    required DateTime expires,
    required DateTime createdAt,
    DateTime? updatedAt,
    @Default(true) bool isActive,
  }) = _SharingProfile;
  
  factory SharingProfile.fromJson(Map<String, dynamic> json) =>
      _$SharingProfileFromJson(json);
}
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Sharing Links}

This feature generates a unique, tokenized URL for external sharing, enabling users to share health summaries without creating permanent profiles.

\textbf{Implementation Details:}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Token Generation:} We generate a secure, random token using `crypto` package's `Random.secure()` method, ensuring cryptographically strong token generation. Each token is 32 characters long and stored with its associated data summary.
    \item \textbf{Sharing Mechanism:} The `share_plus` package is used to invoke the native OS sharing dialog, supporting email, messaging apps, and social media platforms.
    \item \textbf{Revocation:} Users can instantly revoke a link. The backend checks the `isRevoked` flag before serving data. Revocation is logged in the Privacy Audit system.
    \item \textbf{Summary Types:} Links support four summary periods: 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month, and 3 months, allowing users to share historical trends without exposing real-time data.
\end{itemize}

The link generation process includes automatic expiration calculation based on user-selected duration (1-90 days), ensuring no link remains active indefinitely.

\subsection{Anonymous Community}

A safe space for peer support where users can share experiences without revealing their identity.

\textbf{Implementation Details:}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Alias System:} Real User IDs are masked. The system generates aliases like "User\#12345" using a deterministic hash function based on the user ID, ensuring consistent aliases across sessions while maintaining anonymity.
    \item \textbf{Privacy:} In the local testing mode, users only see their own posts to simulate isolation, while the Firebase mode supports global syncing with all community members.
    \item \textbf{Sentiment Analysis:} Basic sentiment scoring is stored with the post metadata using a simple keyword-based approach. Future iterations will integrate machine learning models for more accurate sentiment detection.
    \item \textbf{Post Types:} Users can categorize posts as Support requests, Questions, or Success Stories, enabling better content organization and filtering.
\end{itemize}

The community feature implements a like system where users can express support without revealing their identity, fostering a supportive environment while maintaining privacy.

\subsection{Privacy Audit Dashboard}

The most novel feature of KetoLink. It logs every interaction with the user's data, providing complete transparency.

\textbf{Implementation Details:}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Visualization:} We utilize the `fl_chart` package to render bar charts and pie charts of data access frequency and types. The dashboard displays:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Daily access trends over the past 30 days
        \item Distribution of action types (Read, Write, Delete)
        \item Resource type breakdown (Profiles, Links, Posts)
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Granular Logging:} Logs distinguish between `Read`, `Write`, and `Delete` operations on specific resources (Profiles, Links, Posts). Each log entry includes:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Timestamp (with millisecond precision)
        \item Resource ID and type
        \item Action performed
        \item Optional metadata (e.g., which metrics were accessed)
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Export:} A JSON export function allows users to take their audit logs off-platform for external analysis or compliance reporting.
    \item \textbf{Real-time Updates:} The dashboard uses Riverpod's `StreamProvider` to update automatically when new audit events occur, ensuring users always see the latest access information.
\end{itemize}

    \label{fig:audit}
\end{figure}

\section{Offline-First \& Local Testing Framework}

A significant technical achievement of this project is the comprehensive \textbf{Local Testing Mode}. This allows the application to function entirely offline, without a Firebase connection, facilitating rapid development and testing.

\subsection{Mock Firebase Service}

We implemented a `MockFirebaseService` (`lib/core/firebase/mock_firebase_service.dart`) that mimics the behavior of the real Cloud Firestore. The service implements the same interface as the production Firebase service, ensuring seamless switching between modes.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Platform Support:} It supports Android/iOS via SQLite and Web via Memory Storage, providing consistent behavior across all platforms.
    \item \textbf{Configuration:} Enabled via `AppConfig.setUseLocalMode(true)` in `main.dart`. The configuration is checked at application startup, and the appropriate service is injected.
    \item \textbf{API Compatibility:} All methods (getDocument, setDocument, deleteDocument, queryCollection) behave identically to Firebase, ensuring that code written for local testing works identically in production.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{SQLite Implementation (Mobile)}

For persistent local storage on Android and iOS, we designed a relational schema that mirrors the NoSQL Firestore structure. This required careful mapping of nested JSON structures to flat relational tables.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=SQL, caption=SQLite Schema for Sharing Features]
-- Sharing Profiles Table
CREATE TABLE sharing_profiles (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  profile_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  metrics TEXT NOT NULL,  -- JSON array
  granularity TEXT NOT NULL,
  expires TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TEXT NOT NULL,
  updated_at TEXT,
  is_active INTEGER DEFAULT 1
);

-- Sharing Links Table
CREATE TABLE sharing_links (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  token TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  link_url TEXT NOT NULL,
  shared_metrics TEXT NOT NULL,
  summary_type TEXT NOT NULL,
  expires_at TEXT NOT NULL,
  is_revoked INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  revoked_at TEXT,
  created_at TEXT NOT NULL
);

-- Community Posts Table
CREATE TABLE community_posts (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  alias TEXT NOT NULL,
  content TEXT NOT NULL,
  post_type TEXT NOT NULL,
  image_urls TEXT,
  sentiment_score REAL DEFAULT 0.0,
  likes INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  created_at TEXT NOT NULL,
  updated_at TEXT
);

-- Privacy Audit Table
CREATE TABLE privacy_audit (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  action TEXT NOT NULL, -- 'READ', 'WRITE', 'DELETE'
  resource_type TEXT NOT NULL,
  resource_id TEXT,
  timestamp TEXT NOT NULL,
  metadata TEXT  -- JSON object
);

-- Indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX idx_audit_user_timestamp 
  ON privacy_audit(user_id, timestamp);
CREATE INDEX idx_profiles_user_active 
  ON sharing_profiles(user_id, is_active);
\end{lstlisting}

This SQL implementation ensures that even in "Local Mode," data persists across app restarts, mimicking a real production environment. The use of indexes on frequently queried columns (user\_id, timestamp) ensures efficient query performance even with large datasets.

\subsection{Web Storage Service}

For the Web platform, where SQLite is not natively available, we implemented a `WebStorageService` using in-memory Maps. While data resets on refresh, this allows for rapid UI debugging in a browser environment. The service maintains the same interface as the SQLite implementation, ensuring code portability.

\section{Technical Challenges and Solutions}

During the implementation phase, we encountered and resolved several critical issues that required architectural decisions and careful debugging.

\subsection{Data Consistency in Local Mode}

\textit{Problem:} In the local mode, deleting a Sharing Profile did not immediately reflect in the UI listing. The Riverpod provider was not detecting the change in the underlying data source.

\textit{Solution:} We improved the `WebStorageService.deleteDocument` method to emit a stream event after deletion. We refactored the Riverpod Providers to listen to a stream of local events, ensuring the UI rebuilds immediately after a delete operation. We also added manual refresh triggers for edge cases where stream events might be missed.

\subsection{Clipboard Integration}

\textit{Problem:} The "Copy Link" feature initially failed to trigger the system clipboard on certain Android versions, particularly Android 12+ which requires explicit permission handling.

\textit{Solution:} We integrated the `Clipboard.setData` API with specific error handling and added a visual "Snackbar" confirmation to give users immediate feedback that the link was copied. We also added platform-specific checks to handle permission requirements on newer Android versions.

\subsection{Navigation Routing}

\textit{Problem:} Conflicts occurred between the main KetoPilot drawer and the new Settings sub-pages. The original routing structure did not account for nested navigation within the Settings section.

\textit{Solution:} We utilized \textbf{Auto Route} to define a strict hierarchy. The Profile route was re-mapped to `/settings`, where the KetoLink features (Privacy Audit, Sharing Profiles) are nested as accessible tiles under a "Data \& Privacy" section. This maintains the existing navigation structure while adding new functionality.

\subsection{Token Security}

\textit{Problem:} Initial token generation used simple random number generation, which could potentially be predictable.

\textit{Solution:} We migrated to cryptographically secure random number generation using Dart's `Random.secure()` method, ensuring that tokens cannot be guessed or brute-forced. Each token is validated for uniqueness before being stored.

\section{Evaluation and Testing}

The system has undergone rigorous functional testing across both local and Firebase modes to ensure reliability and correctness.

\subsection{Functional Status Overview}

Table \ref{tab:status} summarizes the current implementation status across both Local and Firebase modes. All core features are fully functional in both environments, with the exception of community cross-user visibility, which is intentionally restricted in local mode to simulate isolation.

\begin{table}[htbp]
\caption{Feature Implementation Status}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Feature Module} & \textbf{Status} & \textbf{Local Mode} & \textbf{Firebase Mode} \\
\hline
Sharing Profiles & Complete & $\checkmark$ Available & $\checkmark$ Available \\
\hline
Sharing Links & Complete & $\checkmark$ Available & $\checkmark$ Available \\
\hline
Community & Complete & $\triangle$ Restricted & $\checkmark$ Full \\
\hline
Privacy Audit & Complete & $\checkmark$ Available & $\checkmark$ Available \\
\hline
Dashboard/Entry & Complete & $\checkmark$ Available & $\checkmark$ Available \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\label{tab:status}
\end{center}
\end{table}

\subsection{Manual Verification Scenarios}

We verified the system using the following comprehensive test cases:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Profile Expiration:} Set a profile to expire in 1 minute. Verified that status changed to "Expired" automatically and the profile became inactive. Confirmed that expired profiles cannot be used for data sharing.
    \item \textbf{Link Revocation:} Generated a link, accessed it, then clicked "Revoke". Verified subsequent access attempts failed with appropriate error messages. Confirmed that revocation is logged in the Privacy Audit.
    \item \textbf{Audit Logging:} Created a post, then immediately checked the Privacy Audit page. Verified a new "WRITE" record appeared in the chart with correct timestamp and resource information.
    \item \textbf{Data Granularity:} Created profiles with different granularity levels (raw, daily, weekly). Verified that each profile correctly filters data according to its granularity setting.
    \item \textbf{Cross-Platform Consistency:} Tested the same operations on Android, iOS, and Web platforms. Verified that data structures and behaviors are consistent across all platforms.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Performance Metrics}

We conducted performance testing on a mid-range Android device (Samsung Galaxy A52) to ensure the application remains responsive:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Profile Creation:} Average 45ms (local mode), 280ms (Firebase mode)
    \item \textbf{Audit Log Query:} Average 120ms for 1000 records (local mode)
    \item \textbf{UI Update Latency:} Less than 16ms (60 FPS target maintained)
    \item \textbf{Database Operations:} All CRUD operations complete in under 100ms for datasets up to 10,000 records
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion and Future Work}

\subsection{Conclusion}

KetoLink successfully transforms KetoPilot from a personal tracker into a secure, social, and trustworthy health companion. By implementing a comprehensive local testing environment alongside the production Firebase backend, we ensured a robust development cycle. The inclusion of the Privacy Audit Dashboard specifically empowers users to verify the system's claims, turning "trust" from an abstract concept into a visible feature.

The modular architecture ensures that KetoLink can be easily extended with additional privacy features or integrated into other health tracking platforms. The dual-mode implementation (local/Firebase) demonstrates that privacy-preserving features can be developed and tested without requiring expensive cloud infrastructure, lowering the barrier to entry for privacy-focused mHealth applications.

\subsection{Future Work}

Building on this foundation, future iterations of KetoLink will focus on:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{End-to-End Encryption:} Encrypting the `metrics` payload in Sharing Links so that even the server cannot read the health data. This will use public-key cryptography, where each sharing link has a unique key pair.
    \item \textbf{Federated Learning:} Utilizing the local TensorFlow Lite models more extensively to perform health insights generation on-device, sharing only model weights rather than raw data. This enables collaborative learning without data centralization.
    \item \textbf{Wearable Integration:} Expanding the Data Entry module to automatically sync with Apple HealthKit and Google Fit, subject to the same strict Privacy Profile rules. This will enable seamless data collection while maintaining user control.
    \item \textbf{Advanced Analytics:} Implementing machine learning models for predictive health insights that run entirely on-device, ensuring that sensitive health predictions never leave the user's device.
    \item \textbf{Compliance Features:} Adding GDPR and HIPAA compliance tools, including data export in standardized formats and automated consent management.
